# Wassup!


**Wassup** is a client-server based desktop chat application written in Javascript and related frameworks. It has a central server and database which is used to connect clients together. Each client has it's own local database. Technologies used are:

**[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)**
: Used to write central server with *express.js* which is a node framework

**[Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/)**
: Used to create client-side desktop application.

**[Socket.io](https://socket.io/)**
: Wassup uses socketio, an implementation of WebSocket protocol for full duplex communication.

**[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**
: Used to create central database with native drivers for node.js

**[PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/)**
: Used on client's local DB. Other options were also available to choose from, but used PouchDB  as it's very small size thus reducing overall size of the app. 

**[HTML/CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)**
: Used to structure client side pages which are rendered by electron.js

**[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**
: Used for styling with some readymade tools. 

**[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)**
: Used for accessing DOM elements with it's rich features and methods.

### Description
Either private chat or group, *wassup* uses websockets to push messages to other sockets(for personal) or rooms(for groups). Client will invoke some event and server will act accordingly. Not that on client side, only one instance of running application is restricted to avoid local-db conflicts; reason being the Main process of electron.js holds state of user currently logged in. However, multiple users can use their respective accounts on same device, but only one can be logged in at a time.
